# Dropout-Prediction-in-Online-Education-Platforms-Using-Machine-Learning
# Abstract	
Online education platforms have experienced exponential growth in recent years,
offering flexible learning opportunities to a diverse global audience. However, high
dropout rates remain a significant challenge, undermining the efficacy of these plat-
forms. This research investigates the application of machine learning (ML) tech-
niques to predict student dropout in online education systems. By analyzing behav-
ioral data, demographic information, and interaction patterns, the study proposes
a robust ML framework to identify at-risk learners early. Results demonstrate that
advanced ML models, such as Random Forests and deep learning architectures,
achieve high predictive accuracy, enabling targeted interventions and improved re-
tention strategies.
Importance of the Problem
The emergence of online education platforms, such as Coursera, edX, and Udemy, has
revolutionized access to education. Despite their transformative potential, these plat-
forms face dropout rates as high as 90% in some courses. Understanding and addressing
the causes of student dropout is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability
of online education.
