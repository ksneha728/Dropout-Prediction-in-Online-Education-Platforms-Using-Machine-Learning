Online education platforms have experienced exponential growth in recent years, offering flexible learning opportunities to a diverse global audience. However, high dropout rates remain a significant challenge, undermining the efficacy of these platforms. This research investigates the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict student dropout in online education systems. By analyzing behavioral data, demographic information, and interaction patterns, the study proposes a robust ML framework to identify at-risk learners early. Results demonstrate that advanced ML models, such as Random Forests and deep learning architectures, achieve high predictive accuracy, enabling targeted interventions and improved retention strategies.
The emergence of online education platforms, such as Coursera, edX, and Udemy, has revolutionized access to education. Despite their transformative potential, these platforms face dropout rates as high as 90  in some courses. Understanding and addressing the causes of student dropout is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of online education. Machine learning provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex datasets generated by these platforms. By leveraging ML algorithms, it is possible to identify patterns and predict dropout risks, enabling timely and personalized interventions. However, challenges such as data quality and availability, model interpretability, privacy concerns, and the dynamic nature of online learning environments present significant hurdles. Addressing these challenges involves implementing adaptive learning models, ensuring data anonymization, and leveraging cloud-based resources to optimize performance and scalability.
